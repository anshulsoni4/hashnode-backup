## About Hacktoberfest 
It is an open source event held in October, when techies from all around the world attended and contributed to numerous open source projects. This program was ideal for beginners.
To complete this program, an individual must submit four or more successful pull requests.

## My Journey 
I was prepared for this one because I had previously engaged in open source activities. I signed up and asked some of my coworkers how I might locate good projects where I could contribute in my particular field of web development. So, let's have a look at the contributions I made as part of the completion of my Hacktoberfest program.

### My Contibutions 

- Created CONTRIBUTING.md file for a project - This was my first hacktoberfest contribution, you may also raise PR for non-code contributions. [Github Link](https://github.com/SGI-CAPP-AT2/code-highlight-n-print/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- Updated the Readme file - There were some points which were not added to this readme [Github Link](https://github.com/Susmita-Dey/Moody/blob/main/README.md)

- Added a loading animation - made this loading animation using css, js. [Github Link](https://github.com/akash-melkeri/loading-animations/pull/19)

- Updated Contact Us section - There were several issues, and the design and components were not very nice, therefore we made some changes to the contact us section and buttons. [Github Link](https://github.com/SaptarshiSarkar12/Drifty/pull/50)

- Hacktoberfest meetup - Made this contribution to the meetup which was organized by DataCode, this contains basic information about myself in an JSON file. [Github Link](https://github.com/datacode-in/Hacktoberfest-Indore-2022/pull/18)

These are some of my previously completed contributions to HacktoberFest 2022. I'm just waiting on my Swags (t-shirt).
